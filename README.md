# Finding-Donors
In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income 
using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results 
and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model 
that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, 
where organizations survive on donations.
